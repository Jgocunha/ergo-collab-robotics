# From Handcrafting to a Certified and Ergonomic Collaborative Workstation: the Digital Transformation Process

**Abstract** — As manufacturing enters an era of mass customization,
new technological solutions with more versatility
and flexibility are brought to the industry. Collaborative robots,
or COBOTs, can now safely work near humans, a key advantage
that enables highly-flexible production and opens the possibility
to tackle the incidence of occupational health problems. Although
the advantages of collaborative robotic manufacturing
have been extensively praised, adapting a manual production
workstation to integrate robotic technology is far from being
a linear and easy process. In this work, we explore this
delicate balance between the ergonomic, production, and safety
requirements in the design of a new collaborative cell. We
explain the different steps of this digital transformation process
and the thought process behind human-robot task allocation
to maximize the collaborative robot efficiency while improving
the work conditions. This work describes the development of a
certified and production-ready collaborative workstation based
on ergonomic criteria. Results show a significant reduction in
the global ergonomic risk score associated with the workers’
actions and postures and an increase in production quotas,
compared to the previous manual process.
